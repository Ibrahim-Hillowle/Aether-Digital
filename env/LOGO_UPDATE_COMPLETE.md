# ✅ LOGO CHANGED TO ANIMATED TEXT

## 🔤 **NEW LOGO DESIGN**
- **Text-Based**: Replaced the static image with pure HTML text "Aether".
- **Typography**: Uses the site's primary heading font (`Inter`) with Extra Bold weight (800) for a strong, modern presence.
- **Accent Dot**: Added a signature dot (`.`) with the brand accent color (`#60a5fa`) to distinguish the brand.

## ✨ **ANIMATIONS**
- **Pulse**: The accent dot has an infinite `pulse-glow` animation, making the logo feel "alive" and powered on.
- **Interact**: On hover, the text scales up slightly (1.02x) and can optionally trigger a gradient shine (if uncommented in CSS).
- **Smooth Transitions**: All states transition smoothly.

## 🔄 **GLOBAL UPDATE**
- **Header & Footer**: Updated the logo in the Navbar and Footer across **all 9 pages** of the website.
- **Consistency**: The logo styles are centralized in `style.css` for easy management.

The brand now feels more tech-forward and clean!
