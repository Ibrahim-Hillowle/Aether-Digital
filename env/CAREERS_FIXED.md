# ✅ CAREERS PAGE & FORM STYLING FIXED

## 🎨 **COLOR & VISIBILITY UPDATES**
- **Form Selects**: Fixed an issue where dropdown options could be unreadable (white text on white background) in some browsers. 
  - Added specific styling for `<option>` elements to ensure high contrast in both Dark and Light modes.
- **Careers Page Contrast**: 
  - Restored the default page background for the "Apply Now" section. 
  - This separation ensures the **Premium Form** (which has its own "card" background and shadow) pops out visually, rather than blending into a same-colored section.

## 🔗 **LINK CORRECTIONS**
- **Navigation**: Cleaned up duplicate "Careers" links in the menu and footer of `jobs.html`.
- **Call-to-Action**: Updated the "View Open Positions" button on the **About Us** page to link correctly to `jobs.html` instead of the contact form.

## 🚀 **STATUS**
The **Careers Page** is now visually balanced, accessible, and correctly linked from the site ecosystem.
