# ✅ ANIMATIONS & BACKGROUNDS REFINED

## ✨ **NEW ANIMATIONS**
- **Floating Avatars**: Added a gentle `animate-float` effect to the user avatars on the Reviews page, making the testimonials feel more dynamic.
- **Staggered Animations**: Confirmed that all cards and sections have automatic scroll-triggered animations via `script.js`.

## 🎨 **BACKGROUND FIXES**
- **Reviews Page**: Corrected the "Client Stories" section background. It now uses the default dark theme rather than a mismatched card color, ensuring the white Testimonial Cards pop out perfectly.
- **Careers Form**: Updated the `.premium-form` style in `forms.css` to use a **high-opacity dark gradient**. This ensures the form is clearly visible and readable on any page background (including the Careers page).

## 🚀 **STATUS**
The website now features consistent depth, motion, and contrast across all key pages.
