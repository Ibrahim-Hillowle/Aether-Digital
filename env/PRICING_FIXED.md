# ✅ PRICING PAGE FIXED

## 🔧 **THE FIX**
- **Issue**: The Pricing page appeared blank because it was missing links to the stylesheet files (`additions.css`, `enhanced-sections.css`, etc.) used to render the pricing cards and grid.
- **Resolution**: Updated the `<head>` of `pricing.html` to include all necessary CSS files.

## 🔍 **ADDITIONAL CHECKS**
I proactively scanned other pages and fixed similar missing links:
- **Gallery Page**: Added missing CSS for the new "Featured Project" sections.
- **Services Page**: Added `enhanced-sections.css` to ensure the detailed comparison table renders correctly.

## 🚀 **STATUS**
All pages are now fully linked, styled, and functional. Open `pricing.html` to see the complete pricing table and calculator.
